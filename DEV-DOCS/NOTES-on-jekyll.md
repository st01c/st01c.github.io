link background_color is in /_sass/basics.scss.s

image links MUST lead with a / and MUST NOT finish with one...0-


changing look (display) of titles on smaller screens is in basic.scss?


---

In setting.yml:

*overlay_background_color*

Gives a nice background color for the small menu background (great), BUT: also
affects a little bit the overlay on main page (bad)

*overlay_opacity* should maybe fix this, but it doesn't seem to -- WHY??

---

In _sass folder:

_content.scss: change page content widthâ€¦





**TO DO (want to do):**

- keep yellow background against mini menu
- (make mini menu in top right corner on all screen sizes?)
- grey overlay (make images less bright) on grid view
