1. integrate short_title frontmatter, to be used as permanent image-overlay if screensize is small.


### GRID

1. constrain height of images (e.g. through aspect ratio thing?)
2. For smaller screens:
  1. again restrain height/size of boxes
  2. have permanent overlay of short_title (for touch interfaces!)
  3. create a set of simple color boxes (or!: all white, but with different types of colored borders)
  3. associate categories with these boxes
  2. display NOT featured_image but color boxes...

1. alternative for grid:
  1. with liquid randomised number
