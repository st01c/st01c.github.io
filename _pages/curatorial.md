I have been curator of the Toronto-based Vector Festival since 2014, and have been involved with other curatorial projects and commissions in Canada, Germany, Austria, and the UK.

My curatorial practice engages broadly with experimental media art, often focusing on digital art, software art,  generative art, and experimental uses of video game technologies.

I am particularly interested in appropriative uses of emerging technologies, developing new exhibition formats for digital work, and exploring intersections between creative and critical practice.

Thematically, past curatorial projects have focused on topics including artificial intelligence and generative, surveillance and privacy issues, critical engineering, among many others.
