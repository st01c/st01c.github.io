After many years in Vienna, Toronto, and London, I' currently based in Dundee, Scotland, where I now hold a research and teaching position as [Senior Lecturer in Computational Arts & Technology](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-zeilinger) at Abertay University.

Much of my current work focuses on artistic and activist experimentation with emerging technologies – specifically artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technologies (aka, the blockchain and 'crypto art'). This frames a broader interest in digital art, appropriation-based art practices, theories of cultural ownership and intellectual property, political economies of new media, and aspects of experimental videogame culture.

A common thread running through many of my activities is the exploration of how concepts such as authorship, creativity, originality, agency, and ownership are reshaped and reconfigured in emerging tech contexts; how these concepts become legally and/or algorithmically encoded in service of capital; and how digital artist/activist communities respond to these developments.

Aside from research, teaching, and tinkering with creative coding, I am also involved in a number of curatorial activities. The most long-running of these is the Toronto-based [Vector Festival](http://vectorfestival.org/), which I have co-curated since 2014.
