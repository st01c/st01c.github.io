After many years in Vienna, Toronto, and London, I've recently taken up a research and teaching position in Dundee, where I now work as [Senior Lecturer in Computational Arts & Technology](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-zeilinger).

My research interests include digital art, appropriation-based art practices, emerging technologies in relation to contemporary art (specifically fintech, AI, distributed computing), theories of cultural ownership and intellectual property, and various aspects of experimental video game culture.

I am currently working on two main publication projects – one on appropriation tactics in digital art, the other on AI art and questions of creative agency.

In addition to research and an interest in live coding and creative coding, I am involved in curatorial and activist projects. This includes the Toronto-based [Vector Festival](http://vectorfestival.org/), which I have co-curated since 2013, and frequent collaborations with [MoneyLab](https://networkcultures.org/moneylab/) and [Furtherfield](http://www.furtherfield.org/). Recently, I have also joined the curatorial collective for [NEoN Festival](https://northeastofnorth.com/) here in Dundee.

I can be reached through this [contact form](/contact) or at my institutional email, _m [.] zeilinger [@] abertay.ac.uk_.
