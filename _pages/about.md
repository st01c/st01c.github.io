#### Short bio (tl;dr):

Martin Zeilinger ([Senior Lecturer in Computational Arts and Technology, Abertay University](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-zeilinger)) is an Austrian researcher and curator currently based in Dundee, Scotland. His work focuses on artistic and activist experimentation with emerging technologies (primarily blockchain and AI), intellectual property issues in contemporary art, and aspects of experimental videogame culture. The most recent outcome of this work is a [monograph](https://meson.press/books/tactical-entanglements/) on AI art, creative agency, and the limits of intellectual property (meson press 2021). Martin has co-curated [Vector Festival](http://vectorfestival.org/) (Toronto) since 2014, and organised the 2019 MoneyLab symposium (London). His research has been published in books including **_Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain_** and the **_MoneyLab Reader 2_**, and journals including **_Philosophy & Technology_**, **_Culture Machine_**, and **_Media Theory_**.

#### Longer bio:

After many years in Vienna, Toronto, and London, I'm currently based in Dundee, Scotland, where I hold a research and teaching position as [Senior Lecturer in Computational Arts & Technology](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-zeilinger) at Abertay University.

Much of my current work focuses on artistic and activist experimentation with emerging technologies – specifically artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technologies (aka, the blockchain and 'crypto art'). This frames a broader interest in digital art, appropriation-based art practices, theories of cultural ownership and intellectual property, political economies of new media, and aspects of experimental videogame culture.

A common thread running through many of my activities is the exploration of how concepts such as authorship, creativity, originality, agency, and ownership are reshaped and reconfigured in emerging tech contexts; how these concepts become legally and/or algorithmically encoded in service of capital; and how digital artist/activist communities respond to these developments.

Aside from research, teaching, and tinkering with creative coding, I am also involved in a number of curatorial activities. The most long-running of these is the Toronto-based [Vector Festival](http://vectorfestival.org/), which I have co-curated since 2014.
