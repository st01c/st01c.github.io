I am London-based interdisciplinary researcher, curator, and media practitioner.

Currently I work as [Senior Lecturer in Media](https://www.anglia.ac.uk/people/martin-zeilinger) at Anglia Ruskin University (Cambridge/UK), and also serve as [curator](http://vectorfestival.org/) of the Vector Festival (Toronto/CAN).

My research interests include digital art, appropriation-based art practices, experimental uses of financial technologies in contemporary art, theories of cultural ownership and intellectual property, political economies of new media, live coding and creative computing, videogame culture, and experimental game art.

I am currently working on completing a monograph, tentatively titled ***Digital Art and the Ends of Appropriation***.

_This website is quasi-permanently under construction – it is the outcome of my ongoing tinkering with Ruby, Liquid, YAML, Sass, Git and other coding tools on the open source web development platform [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). In case the site is currently unstable (or just difficult to navigate), here is a short list of a few upcoming and recent activities, and a link to an external site with copies of my of my [academic work](https://anglia.academia.edu/MZ)._
