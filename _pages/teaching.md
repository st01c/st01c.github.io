I welcome **PhD Supervision inquiries** from prospective doctoral students in all of my areas of interest. I'm happy to consider co-developing applications for funded PhD studentships with suitable candidates. Note that I am also involved on co-supervision at several other institutions in addition to my own.

Potential supervision topics include:

- theory-/practice-based inquiries linking digital art / digital culture to emerging technologies;
- topics related to generative AI (technical, philosophical, socio-economic), AI ethics, AI in visual art, AI and music;
- artistic/activist uses of blockchain technologies;
- topics in experimental game culture;
- political economy of new media;
- para-legal tactics in media art;
- etc.
