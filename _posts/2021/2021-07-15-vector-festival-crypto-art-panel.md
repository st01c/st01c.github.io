I'm delighted that for this summer's [Vector Festival](https://vectorfestival.org/), I'll be convening an online discussion panel featuring **Ruth Catlow** (co-founder Furtherfield, London/UK), **Sarah Friend** (artist and blockchain developer, Berlin/GER), and **Mitchell F Chan** (artist, Toronto/CAN).

The precise date and specific focus is yet to be determined – I'll update with relevant info as it becomes available.
