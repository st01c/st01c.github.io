The amazing-looking [Uroboros Festival](https://uroboros.design/) has kicked off, and is broadcasting from the [DOX Centre for Contemporary Art](https://www.dox.cz/en) in Prague until May 18. Among the festival offerings is a thematic strand on cyrpto-related topics, featuring Laura Lotti, the dada.art platform, Sparrow, folks from Robin Hood / Economic Space Agency, Denis Roio (Jaromil), among others, and also myself.

The [talk](https://uroboros.design/events/on-the-conceptual-affordances-of-blockchain-art/) I've been invited to give will take place at 18:30 CEST (17:30 BST) on 13 May 2021, to be followed by a discussion.

Attendance is free but Zoom [registration](https://uroboros.design/events/on-the-conceptual-affordances-of-blockchain-art/) is required.

Underneath the blurb you'll find a list of some suggested readings that will frame my discussion.

>**Here's the blurb**:<br>
What is the critical potential of financial technologies as an artistic medium? Against the backdrop of unending speculative hype around ‘the blockchain’ and its promises of ‘radical disruption,’ absolute ‘trustlessness,’ and incorruptible cryptographic security (not to mention immeasurable wealth!), this talk explores critical stances of artistic experiments that push beyond blockchain-as-financial-technology. Reaching back towards some of the failures of dematerialized, contract-based Conceptual Art, and forwards to the realm of blockchain-based smart contracts and the ongoing NFT (non-fungible token) craze, the aim here is to sketch a crypto art that is _of_ the blockchain (rather than merely _on_ it), and which interfaces critically with ‘fintech’ tendencies to financialize and hypercommodify creative practice. How, where, and to what ends can such a crypto art manifest? What are its conceptual affordances when it engages the blockchain beyond the creation of artificially scarce digital assets, to align it instead with emerging social technologies that espouse new, radical politics of inclusivity, diversity, and power distribution?

Things are moving at lightning speed in the crypto art / NFT space, so who knows what will happen in the week before my talk. But here's a (not-so little) **list of things I'll be discussing**, for anyone who wants to follow along:
