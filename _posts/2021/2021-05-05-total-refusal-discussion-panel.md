As part of a critical practice & innovation postgraduate seminar for our [MProf in Games Development at Abertay University](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/course-search/postgraduate-taught/professional-masters-in-games-development/), on 5 May I convened a very casual panel discussion that saw the Austrian machinima collective [Total Refusal](http://leonhardmuellner.at/total-refusal/) in conversation with game art pioneer Joseph DeLappe.

After some obligatory tech issue, it was a really stimulating and insightful discussion on the histories, futures, and critical edges of machinima. Here's the video (plus [external link](https://youtu.be/V2YxGRS-HF8)):
