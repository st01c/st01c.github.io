I had the pleasure of participating in a very stimulating and insightful conversation with Chris Kore, Palo Fabu≈°, and Pinar Demirdag at [Uroboros Festival](https://uroboros.design/). The panel was titled 'Shaping the Future Synthetic Realities panel discussion', and excellently moderated by [Lenka Hamosova](https://hamosova.com/). Video below, and more info [here](https://uroboros.design/events/shaping-the-future-synthetic-realities-panel-discussion/).
