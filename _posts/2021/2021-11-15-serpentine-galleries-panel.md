The Serpentine Galleries [Creative AI Lab](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/creative-ai-lab/) features a panel discussion on my new monograph, with Mercedes Bunz (KCL), Daniel Chávez Heras (KCL), Kay Watson (Serpentine Galleries), and Eva Jäger (Serpentine Galleries).

The panel discussion was stremed live on Twitch, and can be viewed (including discussions in the live chat) at the following [link](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1207276107).
