On a panel with **Joseph DeLappe** and 'DrCanonical', a critical AI project devised by **Pip Thornton** and **Andrew Dwyer**, I gave a plenary talk with the title "Law, AI, Oracle" at this year's Critical Legal Conference, hosted by the University of Dundee.

No recording of the panel is available, but you can contact me directly for a draft of my paper.
