Co-authored with my Abertay University colleague [Darshana Jayemanne](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/staff-search/dr-darshana-jayemanne/), and published in the special issue **"Copyright Under COVID-19 in Film and Media Studies"**, co-edited by Kirsten M. Thompson and Brendan Kredell.

Our focus is on exploring how the coronavirus crisis and the resulting shift towards online teaching intensify the urgency of copyright issues pertaining to the use of digital content in higher education teaching contexts. In particular, we discuss the lack of permissions and licensing models that can accommodate videogame-related teaching in higher education.
