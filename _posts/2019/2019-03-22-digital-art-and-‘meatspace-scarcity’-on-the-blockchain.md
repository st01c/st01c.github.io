An essay of mine, **"Digital Art and ‘Meatspace Scarcity’ on the Blockchain"**, is included in the catalogue for an exciting exhibition at the South Korean National Museum of Modern & Contemporary Art in Seoul.

The exhibition (which sadly I won't be able to see in person) features work by Forensic Architecture, Superflex, Zach Blas, Coo Fei, Chris Shen, Harm van den Dorpel, Simon Denny, Sylbee Kim, and Woonghyun Kim.

From the website description of the exhibition:

> "_Vertiginous Data_ is an integrated, multidisciplinary exhibition reflecting our new media environment and offering artistic insights into the social phenomena brought about by digital and data systems. Bringing together experimental works by rapidly emerging Korean and international contemporary artists, the exhibition examines human-made systems such as dig data, blockchains and artificial intelligence, and the unforeseeable cracks that appear between them. Vertiginous Data is arranged according to three main themes: ‘How contemporary artists use data,’ ‘Democracy and anti-feudalism in digital mechanisms,’ and ‘New ideas using digital mechanisms.’"


I'll post a copy of the essay on my website when I have the final document from the editors.
