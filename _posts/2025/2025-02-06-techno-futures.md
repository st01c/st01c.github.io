Blurb: How can we rethink the futures of technology beyond the narrow visions shaped by Big Tech? Join us in exploring imaginative, creative, and situated technological practices that challenge the dominant narratives around emerging technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence.

Powerful tech actors continuously present their visions for the future of technology, framing them as inevitable while obfuscating how they are aligned with their own economic and political agendas. These visions influence infrastructure, regulation, and societal norms while excluding the diverse perspectives and needs of communities. But technology is not a neutral or autonomous forceâ€”it is shaped by human decisions, and alternative imaginaries are possible.

This session will spotlight artistic and creative approaches to emerging technologies, posing questions such as: What could artificial intelligence become if it was framed through values like justice or fabulation rather than efficiency or logic? Or, how can blockchain systems be reimagined to serve community needs? Featuring contributions from artists and researchers, this session invites you to explore creative interventions and bottom-up approaches that redefine the boundaries of technology. Together, we will ask how alternative imaginaries can foster more inclusive, value-driven techno-futures.
