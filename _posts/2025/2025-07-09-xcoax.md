I'm extremely excited to be co-hosting the lucky 13th iteration of xCoAx (the International Conference on Computation, Communication, Aesthetics & X) in Dundee in July 2025!

Open calls for paper submissions, artworks, and performance proposals are open â€“ find all information and submission deadlines on the [xCoAx website](https://xcoax.org/).

We've confirmed two brilliant keynote speakers: [Shu Lea Cheang](http://mauvaiscontact.info/) and [Rebecca Fiebrink](https://researchers.arts.ac.uk/1594-rebecca-fiebrink).
