Friday, Feb 3, 2023, Rosa-Luxemburg-Str. 35, 10178 Berlin

Coinciding with the 2023 Transmediale Festival, I am [launching](https://tldr.nettime.org/@netzkunst/109794439786199864) my new publication _Structures of Belonging_, which is [published as part of Aksioma's Postscriptum series](https://aksioma.org/structures-of-belonging). Aksioma has teamed up with the /rosa Zentrum für Netzkunst in Berlin for this event. Respondents are **Felix Stalder** and **Penny Rafferty**.

Copies of the publication are available for purchase at the event.
