The excellent team from [Radio Web MACBA](https://rwm.macba.cat/en/about-rwm) have recorded an episode of their Son[i]a podcast with me. The Son[i]a expanded radio project has recorded interviews and conversations with artists, researchers, curators, and theorists since for over 15 years.

The full episode is available for [online listening here](https://rwm.macba.cat/en/sonia/sonia-363-martin-zeilinger), and can also be downloaded on all major podcast platforms.

Episode blurb from the project website:

"In this podcast, we talk to Martin Zeilinger about the poetic and political potential of the blockchain, while at the same time tracing a somewhat fuzzy timeline that connects 1960s conceptual art to smart contracts, decentralised autonomous organisations and a host of consensus mechanisms."
