As of August 2022, I'm joining the founding editorial board of the newly established Scottish University Press (SUP). This is a fully Open Access and non-profit academic press run in a collaboration between 18 Scottish universities and university libraries. I'm very passionate about Open Access publishing, so I'm very happy to be involved in this initiative.

The announcement concerning the formation of the editorial board can be found [here](https://www.scurl.ac.uk/sup-editorial-board), and we will continue to release information about SUP opportunities and projects through the press [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ScotUniPress).
