[Outland.art](https://outland.art/) has published my short essay ["Blockchain Vitalism"](https://outland.art/blockchain-vitalism/). The essay concerns artistic experiments with blockchain that treat code outputs as living things, which suggest a radical recalibration of agency and point the way toward alternative systems of social organization. I discuss blockchain art projects by **Sarah Friend**, **Harm van den Dorpel**, **Primavera de Filippi**, and **Masaki Fujihata**.
