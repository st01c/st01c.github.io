I was invited to contribute two entries to the encyclopaedic volume _Chimeras: Inventory of Synthetic Cognition_, published by the Onassis Foundation. The book collects critical perspectives on AI and digital art from over 150 researchers, activists, philosophers, and artists. It's an incredible group of contributors, and I'm very happy to be part of it.

The final product is a beautiful artefact – more about it, as well as order info, [here](https://www.onassis.org/culture/publications/chimeras-inventory-of-synthetic-cognition).

For online reading, the book is now also made available as a free ebook, downloadable as a [PDF](https://www.onassis.org/cms/documents/600/Chimeras_Inventory-of-Synthetic-Cognition.pdf).
