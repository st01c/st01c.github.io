I'm very pleased that my essay 'Structures of Belonging', which was originally commissioned by [Aksioma](https://aksioma.org/) at the end of 2022, has been included in the blockbuster essay collection _The PostScriptUM Anthology (2010–2023): Essays on Art, Technology, Society and the Environment_, co-edited by Daphne Dragona and Domenico Quaranta. The book is as beautiful, thought-provoking, and all around excellent as everything Aksioma publishes, and is available to be ordered [here](https://aksioma.org/postscriptum-anthology).
