My essay on the failed Kodakcoin venture has been [publishing on unthinking.photography](https://unthinking.photography/articles/first-as-snapshot-then-as-decentralised-digital-asset), the critical blogging platform of the London-based Photographers' Gallery. The essay explores the implications of 'image-centric' commercial blockchain projects on the art and business of photography.
