I have a short chapter on critical approaches to research-practice in _Parsing Digital: Conversations in Digital Art by Practitioners and Curators_ (2018). The chapter discusses the experimental recodings of early computer art that I began as part of my research residency at [Akademie Schloss Solitude](http://www.akademie-solitude.de/de/). The book turned out beautifully – [Sally Golding](https://sallygolding.com/news/parsing-digital) edited it, and it was published by the [Austrian Cultural Forum London](http://www.acflondon.org/). Free copies might still be available there – or [click here](https://zenodo.org/record/1494097#.XJkethP7QWq) to download a digital copy. Other contributors include Addie Wagenknecht, Alex McLean, Ellen Harlizius-Klück, Luba Elliott, Manuela Naveau, and Irini Papadimitriou.

The cover image features a visualization of weaving patterns produced by Alex McLean in his TidalCycles live coding software.
