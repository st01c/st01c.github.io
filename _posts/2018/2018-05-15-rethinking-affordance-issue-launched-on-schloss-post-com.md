An online issue I'm co-editing with Ashley Scarlett (ACAD, Calgary/CAN) is [<kbd>now available on Schloss-Post</kbd>](https://schloss-post.com/category/issues/rethinking-affordance/), the digital publication platform for Akademie Schloss Solitude, where Ashley and I are also organising a symposium and co-curating an exhibition this summer. Featuring writing by Jol Thompson, Laura Lotti, foci+loci, FRAUD, Douglas Rodgerson, Ashley Scarlett, and myself, the online issue explores the role artists play in (re-)shaping the uses, functions, and meanings of new and emerging technologies.
