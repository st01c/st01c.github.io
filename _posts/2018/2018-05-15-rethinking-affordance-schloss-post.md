An online issue I co-edited with Ashley Scarlett has been [launched](https://schloss-post.com/category/issues/rethinking-affordance/) on the Akademie Solitude web publishing platform Schloss-Post. The issue features contributions from some of the participants at our 'Rethinking Affordance' symposium, as well as working papers from contributors to our co-edited, upcoming special issue of _Media Theory_.
